# NotEnoughPrecision
Floats, big floats, and bigger floats!

This arbitrary precision floating point library can be used to create n-byte floats with as little or as much precision and range required.
The only limit is your ~~imagination~~ memory!

Also included within the library is the <b>bitsection</b> class used within FatFloats,
an operation and memory interface used to repersent an arbitrary byte array as a virtual n-byte unsigned integer

### Operation complexity 
WIP

# Important Note
This project is currently a WIP. 
As of the last update to this document (12/10/2022) the FatFloat class is not fully functional and both classes are pending optimization
